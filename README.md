I only did this, becaue I wanted to see an example on how someone would do this task. 
I am just learning to program but since I did a few tutorials, I know the most basics things already.

I found this game tutorial on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581KPBVasZQ
Its a 3 Part Series. 

I would have prefered to put the logic in different java objects, for readability. So I will refactor the Code in the near future.
